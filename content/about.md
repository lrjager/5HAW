**5HAW** is my experience as an old data scientist learning new tricks by committing 5 hours a week to tackling something new (to me) and relevant (to data science), but not necessarily something currently needed for my job. 

**My background on day one**

At the start of this project, I would consider myself a classically-trained statistician.  I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, earned back in 2006.  My first statistical software in graduate school was S-PLUS, but then I quickly switched to using R, writing scripts in text files or Emacs.   I've since become an adopter of RStudio and R Markdown for working in R, and have slowly switched to using the tidyverse and ggplot, but I am still most comfortable in base R.  I wrote an R package once (in graduate school, now defunct).  

**Why am I doing this?**

It's easy to become comfortable with the tools you know, unless external circumstances force you to try new things.  Even if the newer tool is really a better tool to use.  For example, I only started using the tidyverse in order to be able to teach it to my students; if left to my own devices, I would not have done so.  But I am a better data analyst now that I have this tool.

**What exactly am I doing?**

I am committing to investing 5 hours a week for an entire year to improving my data science skills.  It may be one hour a day during the work week, or a single five-hour block once during the week. I will have a particular goal in mind for what I want to learn or accomplish each week, but I won't force myself beyond five hours if I don't meet that goal. I will use this blog as a record of what I've done and a resource when I need to revisit old work.

**Why 5 hours?**

Five hours a week is roughly one hour per work day.  It doesn't seem daunting to find one hour a day to spend on professional development.  But if I make it through the entire year, that will be over 250 hours of professional development! (Note: I'm definitely [not the first person](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/317602) who thinks this is a good idea.)
